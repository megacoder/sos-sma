rh-upload-core

This is a script provided with the SOS RPM which provides some automation for EL kernel vmcore file
handling.  The script is capable of compressing, encrypting, checksumming, splitting and uploading a
vmcore file by passing a few options and answering two questions.

The script requires that the system (it is run on) has lftp, openssl, and gzip installed otherwise it
will die.

#### Recommendations ####
  
Its absolutely recommended that you perform an md5checksum and provide the result file to your
technician.  This only takes a few extra minutes and can save a lot of headaches if the file somehow
is corrupted during transfer.

It is not recommended to split the core file unless you are on an unreliable or low throughput
connection.  Lftp will automatically resume uploads if there are connection interruptions but in
some cases splitting the core file into smaller hunks may be desirable.

Because your core could potentially contain data sensitive to your company it is recommended that
core file encryption is at least considered.  While it's not very likely that someone could sniff
that sensitive information while in transit it is possible.  Even with very large core files it takes
less time to encrypt a compressed core file than it does to actually compress it the core file.  
The 10 or so extra minutes it takes may be worth it.

It's likely that you will be running the script remotely so it is recommended that you launch a
screen session _before_ kicking off this script.  That way if your connection is dropped for some
reason the script will continue until it's ready to prompt for destination input.

#### Questions ####

A couple of comments regarding choices made in the design of the script.

Why use gzip instead of bzip2?
While bzip2 /does/ compress tighter than gzip it is significantly slower on large files like
vmcore files.  When compressing a core file speed is more of the essence rather than overall 
compression ratio.

Why not have a switch to provide the ticket number and/or upload destination?
Good question.  While there isn't really a technical reason it seemed more logical to prompt
for this information at the beginning and end of the script run.

Do I have to use this script to upload kernel vmcore files?
No you don't have to use it; however, we would prefer you did. It standardizes the core file
naming convention on the dropbox for one thing.  Secondly it allows you to run this script
and then go work on something else while all of the file operations run; however, if you wish to
stare blankly at a screen waiting for compression to complete so you can upload that's entirely
your perogative. ;-)

I have a suggestion for this script who do I give it to?
Open a ticket with Enterprise Linux support with your request. It will certainly be considered.  That said,
this was written in a shell script with the idea being that anyone could alter it in any way
they see fit.
